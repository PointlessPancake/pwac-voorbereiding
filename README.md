This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). 

### Semantic Versioning
- MAJOR version increments for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version increments for backward-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version increments for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Conventional Commits
We use conventional commits to standardize commit messages:
- `feat:` - A new feature (increments MINOR version)
- `fix:` - A bug fix (increments PATCH version)
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - A code change that improves performance
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build:` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci:` - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore:` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Breaking changes are indicated by `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit message (increments MAJOR version).

For a detailed list of changes for each version, please see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
