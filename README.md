- `fix:` - A bug fix (increments PATCH version)
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - A code change that improves performance
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build:` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci:` - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore:` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Breaking changes are indicated by `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit message (increments MAJOR version).
